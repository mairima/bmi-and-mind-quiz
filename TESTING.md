## Code Validation

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

## Responsiveness
I've tested my deployed project to check for responsiveness issues.

| Mobile | Tablet | Desktop | Notes |

## Browser Compatibility
I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/chrome-terminal.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/firefox-terminal.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/safari-terminal.png) | Chrome: work as expected. Firefox: emojis get cut-off. Safari: some limitations. |

## Lighthouse Audit
I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop.
